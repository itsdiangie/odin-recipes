            <li>In your hand, use about 2 tbsp of mashed potatoes. Form them into your hand, in a bowl shape. Place a spoonful of picadillo in the center of the bowl. Fold the mashed potatoes over, closing the picadillo inside.</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg in a separate bowl. Place the breadcrumbs in a shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Roll each mashed potato ball in the whisked egg. Then roll it in the breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil to about 375 degrees. Place each breaded mashed potato ball in the oil and allow to fry for about 2 minutes on each side until it turns golden brown. Enjoy!</li>
